Notes:

       * This is your chance to tell people who don't know enough about your project
       * "Put yourself in someone's shoes"
       * Here is a reference with template to help you develop one: [https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/project-repo](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/project-repo)
       * Readme files are live document - whenever it is necessary, rewrite and update!

Questions

       * What is challenging about creating a README from scratch?
           * Alex: It is hard to think from someone else's point of view - but this document is not for your, it is for others, so think about what other people need?
               * What would different profiles (user, contributor, team) need
               * Use open canvas!
       * How essential is it to re-write a README
           * For projects where you make a lot changes, it is essential especially for those who are not regularly involved
           * If your project doesn't change much - you don't have to update!
           * Answer is: It depends on how your project is changing - what new information is needed for others to work on the project or use a tool or stay up to date with basic information.

### Notes from breakout discussions

Breakout Room 1 - Spoken

   * Names
           * Andrés
           * Brevin
      
   * Notes
           * Case 1:
               * No coordination bewteen programs, main problem was who was in charge of financial managing
               * There was a mismatch between the goals and the timelines to achieve the goals. The main problem was the lack of understanding at the moment of planning the project to have clear goals and a path to achive the goals.
               * 

Breakout Room 2 - Written/Spoken

   * Names
           * Manifest 
           * Faisal 
           * Alexander
   * Notes
           * Case 2:
               * I worked on many projects to develop African data-sharing portals for genomics (microbiome, genomic variation, and genomic medicine) all the stars aligned.
               * 

               * What happened?
               * Our objective for each project was to create an information-sharing portals with genomic data, supportive in health research. In this, the vision and goals were pretty clear; therefore, coordination was smooth amongst the heterogeneous team composition consisting of data scientists, bioinformaticians, and researchers on one single communication platform and having a monthly meeting. Roles were well-defined right from the start.

Breakout Room 3 - Written/Spoken

   * Names
           * Monsurat Onabajo 
           * Alfredo
           * Joyce Kao
   * Notes
           *  Case :
               * Monsurat - Disaster- Readme was not updated, had to contact organisers after 2 days of bugs , Success - there is always issue so no full on smooth ride yet
               * Alfredo => Success - using GitHub for paper writing helped in organizing work and version control....come from chaos without version control and GitHub process before
               * Joyce => Success - first Open Innovation in Life Sciences Conference in Switzerland, strong team dynamic and organization, Disaster - EU project where no one read the regulations and project manager was not involved in application writing and inherited a mess at the start of the project

Breakout Room 4 - Written

   * Names
           * Seun
           * Nihad
           * Malvika
   * Notes
           * You to Everyone (9 Oct 2024, 17:33)
           * It would have been easier if someone had showed me how to share my code/documentation online when I started the project.
           * A good project for me is OLS. I feel like it has been very collaborative. We are still improving our process but it has largely been very collaborative.
           * W- Seun Olufemi to Everyone (9 Oct 2024, 17:35)
           * When were working a project and we are get collaborators both local and international, but the main lead was the only one who was the contact person
           * W Nihad Alsayed to Everyone (9 Oct 2024, 17:35)
           * For me it was when I developed a doc online for the first time, things were going good but then I noticed overwriting from others so yes you have to keep the texts, restore, and add them back again
           * You (9 Oct 2024, 17:36)
           * I had that this morning working on hackMD where things were getting overwritten. I prefer Framapad as it has timestamps for every edit and older version can be restored.
   * When he secured a more demanding role, the starting struggling the entire project.
   * You (9 Oct 2024, 17:37)
   * So the lesson is to have more people listed? I do have projects where I am the only contact and I do not respond quickly to emails.
   * W- Seun Olufemi (9 Oct 2024, 17:39)
   * Yeah, I think if we are discussed proper delegation, it would have been better.
   * W Nihad Alsayed (9 Oct 2024, 17:40)
   * @S-Malvika Sharan  (she/her) I think two  people at least as contacts? but then there's an arrangement that should take place like splitting the roles following certain inquires pattern!
   * W- Seun Olufemi to Everyone (9 Oct 2024, 17:37)
   * Prior communication and effective communication would have helped
   * W Nihad Alsayed to Everyone (9 Oct 2024, 17:37)
   * Surprisingly communication went well apart from anything else
   * You (9 Oct 2024, 17:38)
       * What did that look like?
       * Were groups helpful at fixing the tech problem? Or did they take in feedback to change the tools?


### Any insights/thoughts/comments to share from your breakout room?

       * Andres: With Brevin and Karin, we focused on chaotic case - lack of coordination between project teams. Coordination mismatch was very chaotic.
           * Misalignment of goals and timeline to achieve those goals! Most taks take longer than we think - understanding that at the beginning of the project is important.
       *  Any example of good project?
           * Faisal: We shared some example of positive project.
               * African genomic data is underrepresented in data base
               * In Tunisia, many experts united to work on the problm - every month we met with project members, had a Slack, had clear roles for people to communicate what was happening - we had always good guidance for next steps.
               * Also bad electricity can cause some challenges in the communications -- but having different channels to continue conversations help.

Notes:

       * copyright: where you can reuse resources without buying/paying for the usage - commercial:
       * Copyleft: people can use it but there are some restriction: like for example, some may not want the use of resources for commercial purpose, or that someone might want users to use the same license
       * Permissive: You are allowed to use with attribution of the original author
       * Public domain: No permission or attribution needed

Questions

       *  What's dual license?
           * Dual licensing is a strategy in which some sort of software project or product is released under two different kinds of licenses, typically an open-source license and a commercial license. That would mean different licensing for the same codebase, satisfying the many needs of users or businesses.
       * To be clear the license applies to the code not the techniques?
           * You can have license for documentations like protocol or methods that use different license (like CC-BY 4.0) than code (like MIT). You technology as a whole will have different license for different components. For example combination of these two license.

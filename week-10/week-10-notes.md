Notes:
   *   Some key characteristics: Transparency - involved with editor and reviewer as well, community engagement, identity disclosure
   *  Constructive engagement because of oppenness of the whole process leads to quick feedback
   *  Some major challenges include implementation barriers (difficulty embracing change including institutionally), bias, fear of criticism
   * Diversity in engagement is a key benefit of research evaluation
   * Challenges include impact on quality
   * Community reviews - some helpful links: review commons - [https://www.reviewcommons.org/](https://www.reviewcommons.org/)
   * [https://sciety.org/](https://sciety.org/) - sciety
   * Pre-registration encouraged in some journals - uncertainty of research in initial stages may be a hinderance for its use for now

Notes:
   * Open source as a medium 
   *  Left shift design - more time in the planning and designing phases than implementation
   *  Contributing to open sources - interacting with people in these spaces; communities, people, code, help to understand how to contribute

## üñ• Talk: Open Access Publication

Pauline (15 min) [‚è∞ 75]

Presenter: Sohail Jannesari

   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1whXW6pH\_wLXZ9YG7IgSNAlK49mvMTz-A/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=101989895789810384353\&rtpof=true\&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1whXW6pH\_wLXZ9YG7IgSNAlK49mvMTz-A/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=101989895789810384353\&rtpof=true\&sd=true)


Notes:

   * Open access journals - it is not very expensive to set these up (unlike the belief that open access is expensive)
   * Stolen Tools - an Anti racist journal: [https://stolentools.com/index.php/stolentools](https://stolentools.com/index.php/stolentools)
   * Challenging  what is called knowledge
       * The types of output that is shared
   *  


Questions

   * What funding sources are there to help with the cost of open access publishing? These are quite high and rarely included in funding.
   * Github is not commonly used by people in my field. There aren't any commonly used open source platforms in my field. How can we direct people to our project in order to get comments and input on our work?

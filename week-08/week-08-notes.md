Notes:

   * The thought collective - the collection of thoughts changes the outcome of a project
   * Individual vs collective discussion of thoughts have different results and outcomes
   * Matters who you involve in the process as this shapes the outcome - be thoughtful about who is invited and included
   * [https://www.cscce.org/resources/cpm/](https://www.cscce.org/resources/cpm/) - Community Participation Model, different modes of interaction with community members
   * What is the mode of interaction and who is doing the interaction - the combination of these two pieces is fundamental to design community engagement for your project
   * **Provide structure** is very important, more than providing flexibility sometimes
   * Helps people to participate, because they know what to expect 
   * Providing structure is fundamental to provide flexibility in other levels!
       * For example, in OLS, people have the flexibility to chose if they want to be in breakout rooms speaking or writing together, in the language of their preference, but this is done under a structure that was designed beforehand
   * "constructive selfishness" - what do you want to get out of a space? Helps to articulate the aims of the session and how people can meaningfully contribute
   * Tempting to use the convening space to cover lots of topics - less space to interact with each other and people get overloaded
   * Tip: write down what you ideally want to cover, then ruthlessly prioritise! Cut it in half! Can always come to topics as back ups
   * Who is facilitating? How can that rotate to allow people to participate in different ways? How are people participating? 
   * In a purposeless session even engaged people will lose their motivation.

Questions

   *  How to define the expectations in terms of interactions?
       * Be explicit about what people will be doing and be clear when you're all done, when you hit the goal.
   * What do you do when things go out of hand?
       * Reframe the issue - am I being too rude if I interrupt someone who's talking more than others, or will I help someone else?

## üñ• Mountain of Engagement!

       * Also Mastodon: [https://fosstodon.org/@KirstieJane](https://fosstodon.org/@KirstieJane)

Notes:

   * Thank you Chad Sansing for the slides! 
   * What is inclusive leadership? Iterating is one of the key parts! It's cyclical 
   * Important to celebrate the contributions, especially the care work, note taking, following up - recognise the less visible work
   * What is leadership? Most people don't know 
       * [https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/leadership](https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/leadership)
       * If you are here and thinking about leadership and empowering others - you are a leader! 
       * There are power dynmics involved but power is different to leadership and vision
   * Mountain of engagement: need a way for people to come into the community and a path to level up in the community - sustained participation
       * Pathway to community leadership: discover, first contact, participation, sustained participation, networked participation, leadership 
       * Open source practices to level up community - learning all about this as part of OLS!
   *  Mountain makes it look like a linear progression but engagement is more like a matrix 
       * people, values, behaviours, learning opportunities, development opportunities, decision-making, value exchange etc etc 
   * Exercise on the slide to think about the ways people engage with your project 
   * You are already leaders and your community members are already leaders! 

Questions

   * Experience with neurodiverse groups - adapting expectations for people from different minorities, how to manage plans, expectations and approaches? How to manage community motivation and engagement? 
       * Everyone is different, for example, autistic people often appreciate a lot of clarity 
       * People with ADHD sometimes struggle with time blindness - clarity is a great answer e.g. backlog of tasks broken down to achievable chunks then allow people to pick ones that meet their interests you might be able to play to peoples strengths (be clear about how the tasks fit together!) 
   * Sustained participation - it is hard! 
   * What do people need, as human beings, to participate in the project? Time, space, talking abou what's on their mind, and a welcome back when they're imperfect


## üë• Value exchanges!

   * Each room will be assigned 3 members
   * Please agree if you use either on this document or the Zoom chat
   * each member will take 2.5 minutes to write down their response
   * In the next 5 minutes they will read through and comment on each other‚Äôs notes either on this document or on Zoom chat

Notes:

   *  How to combine user research to build better communities and programmes
   * Community is a sustainability mechanisms, everyone wants to build community but not everyone can build communities that achieve their other goals
   * Why is community is important? 
       * Every project has an audience - to build sustainability we need to know why we're doing this 
   * How to conduct user research?
       * Set goals and objectives for the community you want to build
       * Identify the current user base and what your extended user base might be 
       * Conduct user research with these groups - understand the user groups and needs 
       * Create personas and user journeys 
       * Iterate and design pathways that can easily guide each user group
   * What do personas represent 
       * Fictional target uses capturing goals, needs, experiences nad behaviours
       * Offer insights into the groups of user types in your audience 
       * Personas can be used to design onboarding and in communicating 
   * Personas needs to be backed up by proper research data 
   * Pathways 

Questions

   * Need to be clear about why you want to build the community - who should be a member of the community? 

## üë• Silent reflections!

[Arielle] (10 min)[‚è∞ 85]

### Questions

*What was insightful about thinking about persona and pathways for inclusion? *

   1. What pathways have you already created? What other personas and pathways you didn't consider for your project?
   1. What are you doing now to provide mentored support to contributors?
   1. What other ways you can create to center voices of marginalised groups?

Reflections: 

   *  Mountain of engagement slide was so insightful! 1. Create Network 2. Collect information 3. Find related experts to use their experiences
   * I've find it insightful that we should consider the people who sit back and don't actively participate as well. I often think that they are just not interested and don't want to be bothered, but if they are there, they might be just waiting for the right opportunity and I would need to design this opportunity for them.

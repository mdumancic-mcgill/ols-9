## During this week‚Äôs cohort call, we will discuss:

   * Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) in open science communities
   * Ally skills: what is an ally, why it matters, and how to act as an ally. 

## üåç Icebreaker question

* *Name /  *What is one favourite tool/tip/practice that has improved access, inclusion or participation for you in a team/project/tech?
   *  Yo / telling me \_how much\_ time a thing will take when asking me to do a job. "come mentor" is hard. "come mentor, it's only an hour a week"? Much easier to commit to! 
   * Ameer / Google Collab
   * Kaitlyn / access to handouts before a session; for code- GitHub discussion boards 
   * Soorena / Live Transcribe app
   * Alex / Take colleagues' ideas seriously
   * Arne /using Zoom
   * Linda / practice would be, being listened to and being asked my opinion in a project i was part of
   * Seun 
   * Musanna
   * Faisal / A favourite practice for improving access and inclusion is using accessibility checkers (e.g., Microsoft Accessibility Checker, WAVE) to ensure content is usable by all and inclusive language tools to avoid biased language. These tools foster thoughtful, inclusive communication in teams.
   * Alexande / Written outlines and memos for meetings
   * Fanwang / GitHub code space is a great tool to enhance inclusion and participation
   * George Lugonzo
   * Nishith/ say less and listen more, inspired from a practice/technique that reads: If you speak more, you are only repeating what you already know; if you listen, you'll learn something new.
   * Laura / Participative projects  (participation ladder) :D It really made me think about how I designed my project.
   * Chika / inviting everyone to share waht access means to them at the start of a project
   * Alfredo / The use of Git and GitHub for group document generation.
   * steve / having everyone set clear expectations from the beginning + the moment things begin going even slightly askew, speaking to each other respectfully (the way adults should)+1 yassssss
   * Lulwama /Co-Design and Co-Creation in the entire research lifecycle 
   * Anemily / suggestion to use GitHub as a place to host educational materials
   * Ijeoma Itanyi/Openess and Transparency from the start
   * Debs / GitHub and Google Docs; WAVE accessibility tool
   * Vincent 
   * Chiedozie 
   * Mona / Torello
   * Jaimie/ Understanding that participations can come in different forms and allowing group members to choose how they wish to contribute.
   * Clotilde /
   * A clear plan before the meeting

#### Exercise: Identify your power and privilege (you can keep these notes to yourself)

Link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xlRf6265EovRoolY1DFLE4N7N\_8jajNvDS9YT1\_Nc\_I/copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xlRf6265EovRoolY1DFLE4N7N\_8jajNvDS9YT1\_Nc\_I/copy)

**Notes**

* I noticed that I have more power, and I am definitely more privileged than I thought! Fascinating activity. Thanks

### Seconario-based discussion

* Demo scenario: At a meeting, a woman makes a suggestion, but no one picks up on it. Later on in the same meeting, a man makes the same suggestion and is given credit for it.

### Breakout 

* Introduce yourselves briefly
* Choose a moderator and gatekeeper

#### Scenarios

* Choose one of these scenarios:
1. A team meeting where brainstorming for a new project is underway. Maya, a team member who is a non-native English speaker, suggests a unique idea, but her suggestion gets ignored. A few minutes later, another team member, John, restates the same idea and receives praise for it.
2. A colleague of yours says, "It's great to have diverse representation, but let's not lower the bar for recruitment." Before you can reply, another colleague says, "Oh yes, true. Let's be careful not to lower the bar."

* **Tips:**
   * Be short, simple, firm
   * Don't try to be funny
   * Play for the audience
   * Practice simple responses
   * Pick your battles
   * Treat ally actions as bare minimum expectation

* **Here are a few responses you can have to respond to such situations:***
   * *Can you explain that?*
   * *That's not okay. *
   * *Please keep it respectful *
   * *I don't find that funny*
   * *It's inappropriate/irrelevant*
   * *Not cool!*
   * *We don't do this here.*
   * *Can you keep it on topic?*
   * *Stop harassing me.*
   * *Anything else?*

### Notes:

**Group 1:** 

* Names: Anemily, George, Alex, Debs
* Notes:
   * Scenario 1
   * I usually chime in after the man repeats the suggestion and say something to the effect of "Yes I agree with <man's name> that we should follow <woman's name>'s suggestion"
   * The scenario often seems unintentional. Simply speaking up and sharing credit or asking the woman for more of their thoughts has been a good solution from my perspective. In the case it‚Äôs repeated or malicious a blunt conversation with the man has been effective.
   * Scenario 2
   * Generally Equity initiatives make it so good candiates are not passed over due to their marginalized identity, I'm not sure explaining that literally would come across though.
   * You might say something like "why would you assume there are no good candidates with diverse identities"

**Group 2: **

* Names: Suzanne, Mona, Ajitesh 
* Notekeeper: Ajitesh
* Notes:
   * Scenario 2
   * Asking the person to clarify why they think that allowing for diversity would lower the bar.
   * Rephrasing their opinion to ask if they mean that we should both focus on diversity and assessing qualifications

**Group 3:**

* Names: Shay, Vincent, Alfredo
* Moderator: Vincent
* Notekeeper: Shay
* Notes: 
   * Scenario 2
   * The issue here is the assumption that increasing diversity could compromise the quality or standards of recruitment
   * We need to define the qualifications (what the bar for recruitment should be), but diversity does not conflit with that need
   * High standards are essential for recruitment
   * The reply from our side would be: "I‚Äôd love to continue this conversation and explore ways we can ensure both excellence and diversity in our recruitment processes."

**Group 4:**

* Names:  Ameer, Arne, Soorena
* Moderator: Ameer and Arne
* Notekeeper: Soorena
* Notes: 
   * Scenario 1: ask Maya to state her ideas again in the 2nd meeting. Praise and acknowledge both and move on
   * Before meetings, go over active listening practices for meetings
   * Scenario 2: Emphasize that candidates be assessed on where they started from in their journey to apply. 
   * Wonder what type of organization they have?
   * Challenge the assu

**Group 5: **

Names: Faial, Chika
Moderator: Faisal
Timekeeper: Chika

**Group 6:**

* Names:  Lulwama, Nishith, Linda
* Moderator: Lulwama
* Notekeeper: Nishith
* Notes: Scenario 1: 
   * To ensure team members like Maya receive the recognition they deserve, it's crucial to acknowledge their contributions actively. Redirect credit immediately if someone restates their idea, for example, by saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting point, John. It sounds like what Maya mentioned earlier. Maya, would you like to elaborate?‚Äù If Maya‚Äôs suggestion is overlooked, bring it back into the discussion by revisiting her idea and encouraging further exploration. 
   * Long-term strategies include fostering an inclusive culture through active listening, structured turn-taking, and publicly recognizing contributions in meeting notes. Supporting marginalized voices through mentorship and confidence-building can further empower individuals like Maya to share their ideas confidently.
   * Additionally, if such patterns are recurring, highlight them respectfully by saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ensure we‚Äôre giving credit where it‚Äôs due and listening to everyone equally.‚Äù

**Group 7:**

* Names: Clotilde, Alexis et Laura
* Moderator: Clotilde
* Notekeeper: Laura
* Notes: 
   * Scenario 2. 
   * Alex: He would ask what do they mean by low the bar ? He will pinpoint it is porblematic, and sensitize people they should not be assuming diversity means lowering the bar. If they don't care, he would d√©solidarider. 
   * Tous: poser des questions est importante pour faire le group reflechir. 
   * Clotilde: si sont des persones qui ont l'habitude de dire comme ca, elle repondrai pas et laisserai la discussion. Mais si c'est une personne ouverte a la discussion, elle discutera  avec eux. 
   * Tous sommes d'accord !

**Group 8: Writing **

* Names: Kaitlyn, Emilie, Gracielle
* Moderator: Gracielle
* Notekeeper: Gracielle

Notes: 
   * We chose scenario 2
   * We think the best answer would be something like "what do you mean?" / "can you explain that?", but this could escalate the problem depending on your power position in the situation. It can be an educational moment or it can be seen as confrontational.
   * An alternative would be to state something like: "nobody was suggesting lowering the bar"
   * Asking the person to rephrase can be less confrontational

### Seconario-based discussion

* Demo scenario: At a meeting, a woman makes a suggestion, but no one picks up on it. Later on in the same meeting, a man makes the same suggestion and is given credit for it.

### Breakout 

* Introduce yourselves briefly
* Choose a moderator and gatekeeper

#### Scenarios

* Choose one of these scenarios:
1. A team meeting where brainstorming for a new project is underway. Maya, a team member who is a non-native English speaker, suggests a unique idea, but her suggestion gets ignored. A few minutes later, another team member, John, restates the same idea and receives praise for it.
2. A colleague of yours says, "It's great to have diverse representation, but let's not lower the bar for recruitment." Before you can reply, another colleague says, "Oh yes, true. Let's be careful not to lower the bar."

* **Tips:**
   * Be short, simple, firm
   * Don't try to be funny
   * Play for the audience
   * Practice simple responses
   * Pick your battles
   * Treat ally actions as a bare minimum expectation

* **Here are a few responses you can have to respond to such situations:***
   * *Can you explain that?*
   * *That's not okay. *
   * *Please keep it respectful *
   * *I don't find that funny*
   * *It's inappropriate/irrelevant*
   * *Not cool!*
   * *We don't do this here.*
   * *Can you keep it on topic?*
   * *Stop harassing me.*
   * *Anything else?*

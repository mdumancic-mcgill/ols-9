### Breakout Room: Speaking and Writing Preference
This will help us assign you to the breakout room with the format of your choice:

- **S-En-** for spoken discussion in English  
- **S-Fr-** for spoken discussion in French  
- **S-Fr/En-** for spoken discussion in French or English  
- **S-Es/En-** for spoken discussion in French or Spanish

#### Where to indicate preference?
In your Zoom name:  
You can edit your Zoom name directly (click on the three dots on the top right of your video) and add one of these letters in front of your name.  
Please let us know in the chat your preference for the breakout room today - a co-host will edit your name to add one of these letters.  
If you are okay with both, please choose one for this week so that the hosts can assign you to a breakout room during the cohort call.

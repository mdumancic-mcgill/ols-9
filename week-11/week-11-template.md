### Breakout Room: Speaking and Writing Preference  
This will help us assign you to the breakout room with the format of your choice:  
- **W-** for written reflection-based exercise in the main room  
- **S-En-** for spoken discussion in English  
- **S-Fr-** for spoken discussion in French  
- **S-Fr/En-** for spoken discussion in French or English  
- **S-Es/En-** for spoken discussion in Spanish or English  

**Where to indicate preference?**

- Edit your Zoom name directly (click on the three dots on the top right of your video) and add one W or S letter in front of your name.  
- Let us know your preference in the chat so that a co-host can edit your name.  
- If you're okay with both, choose one for this week so that the hosts can assign you appropriately.

## üåç Icebreaker Question

### Reflection Exercise: Silent Note-Taking

- **Self-reflection:** No need to share if you'd like to keep your notes private.  
- **Prompt:**  
  - What action have you taken or can you take to empower and sustain your well-being?  
    (This might involve removing something, doing less of something, or addressing challenges outside your control, e.g., power imbalance or discrimination.)  
  - How did this self-reflection activity make you feel?

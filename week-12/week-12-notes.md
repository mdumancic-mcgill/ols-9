* **Questions**
   * Laura: How can we make open hardware accessible to people. As there might be economical barriers to get all the material 
       * Stephane: We were facing limitation of resources - you need some parts to assemble them into tech. It takes months to source parts. Hardware movement requires people to think about logistics.
       * Economic barrier is there - simplication of design can allow accessibility and. cost effectiveness.
       * Prototypes allow investers and accelerator programmes to fund next stages.
           * Laura: Thank you for the response ! I didn't think about all the logistics! We also don't have Amazon in my home country and didn't think about how it would impact the logistic!
           * What country is your home country? One of my mentees from OLS-6 taught me a lot about her open hardware shipping challenges in latin America - and she was based in Argentina herself.  [https://github.com/talleresopensourc](https://github.com/talleresopensourc)
   * Faisal: Stephane, we would be delighted to invite you to give a talk at one of our webinars hosted by the Data Science Initiative Africa Consortium, with the aim of inspiring younger generations of researchers across Africa
       * Will put you in touch.

## 🖥 Talk: Open Engagement of Social Actors

Malvika (15 min) [⏰ 45]

* Presenter: Laura Carter
   * Contact / social: [https://scholar.social/@LauraC\_rter](https://scholar.social/@LauraC\_rter)
   * Slides: [https://zenodo.org/records/14269064](https://zenodo.org/records/14269064)

* Notes:
   *   Laura is based in Seattle - is from the UK
       * Is a policy tech fellow in California, worked in Ada Lovelace and Amnesty
       * Part of OLS since 2021
   * Research is all about people
       * Taking people and their experiences seriously
   * When thinking about participatory research - we can think about three levels
       * Open source practices where people - paid or professional - can develop things openly: use, reuse etc.
       * Citizen science where crowdsourcing with interested people from the public - often unpaid - are involved
   * Participatory research goes further
       * Non professional researchers design research question
       * For example: Autspaces - is engaging with people to share their sensory experiences to make public and workspaces appropriate for autistic people 
   * So in our research, we need to think about "who is participating?"
       * In Laura's work participants can be co-authors, peer researchers, research subject, citizen assembly
   * Ladder of participation - Arnstein (1961)
       * The higher up you go in the ladder, the higher the partcipation from broader citizen we can have
       * non participation --> Tokenism --> citizen power
   * Not everyone involved in the project will be in the same space even within the same group -- including yourself
       * It doesn't mean you don't have power at all
   * determine where you are at the ladder
       * How can you use the power you have to bring in people, move them along to different part of ladder
   *  being open about these decisions allow more people to partcipate - distribute more power

* Questions
   * Vincent: Does participatory research process apply to specific subset of project?
       * Laura: What is helpful is to think about people who are involved in research. even if you don't have participatory reseach by design, you can use this framework to think about who is in your research.
       * MS: Here is a chapter Laura wrote with Arielle on advocacy as a form of participation: [https://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/activism](https://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/activism)
       * Laura: I am a big fan of unions for building participation and power - [https://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/activism/activism-unionisation](https://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/activism/activism-unionisation)
   * Laura: I really like the presentation! I always tend to think about projects where there is a leader, I guess that is what we have been seen along the years so we are biased to that. Would like to know how are education projects more participative? I think that makes people more motivated to participate and make something useful for them out of the project 
       * One strategy I really like when building open and participatory educational projects is to design a structure where instructors can use and build upon each other’s educational materials. That’s one side! Another side is when you can include learners in the decision making process on designing the syllabus and activities of the course.
       * Agree with Gracielle - the more you can bring people into decision-making, the better :)
       * I really like those ideas! I'll do my best to include them in my project ! Also, it is less intensive for the "project leader" as decision-making is more focused on what participants really need.
       * Leaders often end up in more of a coordination role than a decision making role, in this case…
   * Faisal: Please briefly describe the possibility of drafting a Policy on this concept. With policies in place, a more would be done. I am about to complete a 10-week training program with eLearning Global Health at the University of Washington on "Policy Development \& Advocacy in Global Health
       * LC: Global health is one of the areas where there's quite a lot of work that you can draw on! This is a good guide to start with: [https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Participatory%20Health%20Research%20Methods%20toolkit.pdf](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Participatory%20Health%20Research%20Methods%20toolkit.pdf)
       * Also 'participatory research' is one of the buzzwords that researchers (and funders) are starting to like a lot, so if you have a framework for it, it's difficult for people in power to argue that they want their work to be less participatory..

## 🖥 Talk: Diversity of knowledge: Bibliodiversity

[HOST] (15 min) [⏰ 60]

* Presenter: Leslie Chan
   * Contact / social: 
   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hkn8tTVzzEet7E68\_UeZK1lTLe0Pf623jOPa0aJA0xQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hkn8tTVzzEet7E68\_UeZK1lTLe0Pf623jOPa0aJA0xQ/edit?usp=sharing)

* Notes:
   * Works in Uni of Toronto. Established Knowledge Equity Lab
   * Come  from access barriers in world of scientific publications
       * Grew up in hong kong, have long history of knowledge and science -- similarly many parts in the world producing knowledge and science but that knowledge is not always represented in our library systems
       * Knowledge systems are controlled by handful of commercial actors
       * Map shows unequal contributions and participation in research and knowledge production
   *  Prof James Tumwini started journal for African Health Sciences
       * gives example of who is the gatekeeper and who makes decision about what kind of knowledge is produced and distributed
       * [https://knowledgeequitylab.ca/podcast/ep3/](https://knowledgeequitylab.ca/podcast/ep3/)
   * Bibliodiversity means amplifying different kinds of knowledge to be produced and distributed
       * We need more initiatives to be recognised and supported - known to everyone around the world
           * Relates to a last presentation by Sohail: [https://stolentools.com/index.php/stolentools](https://stolentools.com/index.php/stolentools)
   * We see a rapid growth in publication - not necessarily advancement of knowledge
       * Metrics demand researchers to publish more - overproduction instead of real knowledge sharing
       * Corporate consolidation is marginalising people already outside the system
   * Research community is calling for bibliodiversity and against corporate actors and traditional university metrics
   * Bibliodiversity is against MONOCULTURE OF MIND (comes from Vanda Shiva's work)
       * Anglophone monopoly
   * Leslie's work mapped the work of Elsevier to create end to end system/infrastructure
       * Contextualising openness: [https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science](https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science)
       * Connecting the knowledge commons: [https://books.openedition.org/oep/8999?lang=en](https://books.openedition.org/oep/8999?lang=en)
   * Bibliodiversity and situated knowledge
       * Diversity of  knowledge form and expression, epistemology and ontology, knowledge systems, knowledgemakers, ways to value impact
   * From bibliodiversity  to pluriversal ecology of  knowledges

* Questions
   * Just to confirm….bibliodiversity means having many different options for publishing. Is that right? And this is being threatened because certain publishing companies are buying up competitors and adding end to end publishing services
       * MS: Different kinds of knowledge - different forms of knowledge production and sharing - including poetry, art, story telling, decentralised ways to do research and pursue science (not limited to profession etc.)
           * Threatened because of that, and generally beaches elf colonisation of different form that benefits specific powerful entities
       * Leslie: Bibliodiversity is about diversity of format, languages and outlets -- also diverse forms of knowledge itself (knowing the world beyond the mechanics of publications)
   * What strategies can publishers adopt to prioritize bibliodiversity, especially under financial pressures that favour commercially viable works over diverse or experimental content?
       * Many open access option:
           * Radical open access collectives ([https://radicaloa.postdigitalcultures.org/)](https://radicaloa.postdigitalcultures.org/))
           * Open libraries of humanities
           * African mind: Africa based scholarship
           * Collective payment models are quite common
       * We should support smaller publishers
           * Publish with them

## 👥 Breakout discussion: Open Science and You

[HOST] introduces, [HOST] makes breakouts (10 min) [⏰ 75]

15 minutes, ~3/4 ppl per room

### Instructions for the room

* Discussion prompts for the room:
   * Do you practise or advocate for open source software, infrastructure and practices?
       * If you do, explain how.
       * If you don’t, explain what you think the difference is between practising open science and advocating for it.

* Directions for written discussion rooms:
   * Each room will be assigned 3/4 members
   * Please agree if you use either on this document or the Zoom chat
   * each member will take 2.5 minutes to write down their response
   * In the next 5 minutes they will read through and comment on each other’s notes either on this document or on Zoom chat

### Notes from breakout discussions

**Breakout Room 1 - Written/Spoken**

* Names
       * Vincent
       * Gracielle
       * Lulwama
       * Stephane
* Notes
  * I think practising open science is to be a user (e.g., use open source web browsers) or a creator of open science products (e.g. open access papers); to be an advocate is to include collective participation in your practise, and also promoting the use of open science in ways you don't use.

**Breakout Room 2 - Written/Spoken**

* Names:
   * Kim
   * Jane
   * Faisal
   * George
* Notes:
   * Open science - Involvement of others who are outside your research group
